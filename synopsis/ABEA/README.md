## Preface
The idea of the whole auth-system came to my mind a few months ago. I've tried a couple of times and failed, every time, with every framework.
I see it as a possibility to learn more about OAuth2 and so on, since all frameworks add to much abstraction to really gain knowledge about inner workings. So I'm going to get my hands dirty and implement it in a bare-metal approach.
